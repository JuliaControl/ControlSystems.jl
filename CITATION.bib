  abstract     = {ControlSystems.jl enables the powerful features of the Julia language to be leveraged for control design and analysis.<br/>The toolbox provides types for state-space, transfer-function, and time-delay models, together with algorithms for design and analysis.<br/>Julia's mathematically-oriented syntax is convenient for implementing control algorithms, and its just-in-time compilation gives performance on par with C.<br/>The multiple-dispatch paradigm makes it easy to combine the algorithms with powerful tools from Julia's ecosystem, such as automatic differentiation, arbitrary-precision arithmetic, GPU arrays, and probability distributions.<br/>We demonstrate how these features allow complex problems to be solved with little effort.},
