# 1. SETUP: Load packages and define the system
using ControlSystemsBase, JuMP, Ipopt, Plots, Printf

# Define the continuous-time plant model (a simple damped oscillator)
P_s = tf(10, [1, 2, 10])

# Define performance weights
# Weight for sensitivity S (good tracking at low frequencies)
Ws = tf(1, [1, 1e-4]) 
# Weight for control effort U = Q*S (penalize high-frequency control)
Wu = tf([1, 0], [1/20, 1])

# T = PQ
# CS = Q


# Discretize the system with a sample time Ts
Ts = 0.05

# 2. YOULA PARAMETER (Q) SETUP

# Objective Function: Minimize ‚à´ |Ws*S|¬≤ + |Wu*Q|¬≤ dœâ

# Set the nonlinear objective function (sum over all frequencies)
@objective(model, Min, sum(J_S[i] + J_U[i] for i in eachindex(w)))

# Constraint: Peak of sensitivity function |S(jœâ)| ‚â§ Œ≥
